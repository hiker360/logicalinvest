To run QuantTrader place the most recent executable file and the QuantTrader.ini file in a folder and double click on the executable.
Don't place this folder in the official Windows program folder, but rather where you keep your normal documents.

If you start QuantTrader without QuantTrader.ini, then an empty file will be created and you can begin to create your own strategies.

Strategies included in the QuantTrader.ini file:
Normally there are 2 strategies for each strategy type present:
Nasdaq100 - this is the equity only strategy without hedge
Nasdaq100 hedged - this is the finished and hedged Logical Invest strategy

Attention!!!! -----------------------------------------------------------
When you start a new version of QuantTrader the first time, Windows will display a blue warning windows saying:
"Windows protected your PC"-"Dont run"
Here you have to click on the "more info" link and then click on "run anyway" to start QuantTrader.

Please report errors to fpgrossmann@gmail.com. Attach the QuantTrader.ini file so that I can see the error. You may need to change the .ini extention to .txt for some email clients.
